1.	Compile this file.  If you get any error, it means that you haven’t typed correctly the given codes.
2.	After a successful compilation, now try to run. What’s the output?
3.	List ALL the following items based on the Triangle class:

a) object                    

- Triangle                           

b) user-defined methods with return value

     - getHeight()
     -getBase()
     -getArea()
     
c) user-defined methods with passing-parameters 

    - set(height,base) =>  set (double len, double b)
    
d) accessor methods

       -setHeight()
       -setBase()
       -set(double len, double b)
       
e) mutator methods

       -getHeight()
       -getBase()
       -getArea()
